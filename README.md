# toll_vehicles
**Instructions:**  
You are required to develop a program that models a toll system. Toll stations have a name, the city where they are located, and a numerical value that represents the total toll amount collected.  

Vehicles arriving at a toll station have a license plate number. The toll charges different amounts depending on the type of vehicle. If it is a car, the toll amount is $100. If it is a motorcycle, $50. If it is a truck, the toll amount depends on the number of axles, charging $50 per axle.  

The toll station must calculate the toll amount for each vehicle arriving and the total toll collected. At the end, the system should print a list of the vehicles that passed through the toll and the total amount collected.  



**Requirements:**  
- UML class diagram  
- Mandatory unit tests (minimum coverage 70%)  
**Deliverables:**  
- GitHub repository  
- Screenshot of the class diagram or a public link to the diagrams.net file  
- Screenshot of the testing section in VSCode showing that the test coverage requirement has been met, including the number of tests performed.  
**Note:** For the screenshot of the testing section, refer to the attached example. The exercise cannot be done using Spring Boot
